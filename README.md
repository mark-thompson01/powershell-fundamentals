## 📌 What I’ve Learned

- **A Solid Understanding of PowerShell Theory**  
  Combined with hands-on application of cmdlets, object-based pipelines, administrative task automation, and scripting fundamentals.

- **Effective Use of Core Cmdlets**  
  Practical mastery of cmdlets like `Get-Command`, `Get-Module`, `Get-Process`, `Set-NetFirewallRule`, and more—showing how to discover, inspect, and manage system resources.

- **Scripting Fundamentals & Error Handling**  
  Building reusable scripts with variables, loops, functions, and structured error handling (`try` / `catch` / `finally`), plus learning when to use `Write-Host` vs. `Write-Output` for logging and debugging.

- **Real-World Automation Scenarios**  
  Automating everyday IT tasks such as batch Active Directory user creation, firewall rule management, log archiving, and scheduled reporting—demonstrating how to apply PowerShell in a production-style environment.

- **Cross-Platform Awareness**  
  Understanding differences between Windows PowerShell (built on .NET Framework) and PowerShell Core (built on .NET Core / .NET 5+), and writing scripts that can run across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- **Documentation & Teaching Skills**  
  Crafting clear, step-by-step explanations, embedding screenshots, and organizing content for a learner-friendly lab—strengthening both technical and communication abilities.
